# ValiRel: Validation of Biomedical Relations using Lightweight LLMs

## Overview
ValiRel is a project that explores the effectiveness of lightweight large language models (LLMs), specifically Llama, for validating semantic biomedical relations between MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) keywords. The repository utilizes the Llama model to validate these relations by performing multiple verifications, leveraging a dataset generated by the [MeSH2Wikidata Project](https://example.com/mesh2wikidata), which includes semantic relations between MeSH keywords with varying pointwise mutual information (PMI) scores.

### Repository Structure
The repository contains several directories:
- `input`: Contains the original dataset with 35,719 semantic relations between MeSH keywords, grouped based on their PMI values.
- `calibration`: Holds the calibration results where verification repetitions are performed to achieve stable clustering.
- `add`: Contains the list of new relations suggested to be added to Wikidata based on the validation results.
- `verify`: Contains the list of relations that are flagged for verification or removal from Wikidata.

## Data Description
- **Input Data**: Contains two subsets:
  - **PMI < 2**: Relations between MeSH keywords with PMI scores less than 2, indicating limited statistical association.
  - **PMI >= 2 (Unlinked)**: MeSH keyword pairs with PMI scores of 2 or more but lacking a corresponding relation in Wikidata.

## Experiments

### Calibration Experiment
In the first experiment, we aim to establish a threshold that allows the Llama model to distinguish between true and false relations effectively. We sampled 500 random biomedical relations with limited PMI and existing Wikidata relations, which were validated by querying the Llama model multiple times.

- **Number of Repetitions**: We queried the Llama model 30 times for each relation to measure stability in validation.
- **Result Metric (R)**: Defined as \( R = \frac{T}{T+F} \), where \( T \) represents the count of true classifications and \( F \) the count of false classifications.
- **Clustering Analysis**: After six repetitions, relations begin to stabilize, indicating their final clustering based on the model's assessment.

### Findings
- **True Relations**: Relations with \( R(6) > 0.5 \) are deemed true.
- **False Relations**: Relations with \( R(6) < 0.866 \) are deemed false.
- Full results of this calibration experiment are documented in the `calibration` directory.

### Refinement of Relations
Based on the calibration, we refined our lists of relations as follows:
1. **Relations to Add**: Relations with an \( R(6) > 0.5 \) are listed for potential inclusion in Wikidata. These are saved in the `add` directory.
2. **Relations to Remove**: Relations with an \( R(6) < 0.866 \) are identified for potential removal from Wikidata. These are saved in the `verify` directory.

## Repository Contents

- `input/`: Contains the original dataset with semantic relations and PMI scores.
- `calibration/`: Contains calibration results of Llama's validation results after six repetitions.
- `add/`: List of relations recommended for addition to Wikidata.
- `verify/`: List of relations flagged for verification or removal from Wikidata.

## Requirements

- **LLM Framework**: Ensure that the Llama model is set up and accessible.
- **Dependencies**: List any required libraries, such as those for data handling, text processing, and any additional libraries for managing Llama queries.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure that the input data is available in the `input` directory.
2. **Run Calibration**: Execute the calibration experiment to observe clustering results after multiple verifications.
3. **Generate Output**: Based on calibration results, refine the relations and save them in the `add` and `verify` directories.
